This repository (learnsML) contains projects and resources related to learning and practicing machine learning concepts.

## Project 1: Customer Segmentation using K-means

### Description

This project focuses on customer segmentation using the K-means clustering algorithm. The notebook (`Customer Segmentation using K-means.ipynb`) explores the dataset and applies K-means clustering to group customers based on certain features, such as Annual Income and Spending Score.

### Project Structure

## Project 2: E-commerce Customer Churn

The main goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on historical customer data. The predictive model utilizes various features such as customer demographics, purchase history, and customer interactions to forecast whether a customer is likely to churn in the future.
